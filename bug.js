While using Expo CLI, I encountered a peculiar error during the development of a React Native application.  The error message was vague, offering little insight into the root cause.  The application would build and run successfully on my development machine but consistently fail on a different machine, both using the same Expo version. The build process would halt without clear error messages, sometimes reporting issues with native modules, other times mentioning issues with the manifest file, despite no changes being made to the manifest itself. The error was intermittent, occurring only sometimes and seemingly at random.
