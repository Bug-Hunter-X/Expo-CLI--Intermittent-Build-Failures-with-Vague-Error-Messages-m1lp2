// bugSolution.js
// This solution focuses on comprehensive troubleshooting steps and best practices to mitigate intermittent Expo CLI build errors.

// 1. Clean Expo Cache:
// Before building, always clean the Expo cache to remove any potentially corrupted files or outdated dependencies.
expo prebuild --clean

// 2. Check Node.js, npm, and Expo CLI Versions:
// Ensure consistent versions of Node.js, npm, and the Expo CLI on all machines to prevent conflicts.
// You can use npm or nvs (Node Version Switcher) to manage Node.js versions.

// 3. Verify Environment Variables:
// Check if any environment variables might be causing conflicts.  Differences in environment settings between machines could lead to inconsistent results.

// 4. Review System Logs:
// Examine system logs (Windows Event Viewer, macOS Console) for errors that might be related to Expo or the build process.

// 5. Examine Manifest File:
// Carefully review the `app.json` or `app.config.js` file for any potential errors, typos, or inconsistencies in configurations.

// 6. Test on Different Environments:
// Test the build on various environments including simulators/emulators and physical devices to identify if the error is device-specific or environment-specific.

// 7. Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:
// If the problem persists, create a minimal reproducible example. This isolates the core issue, allowing for easier debugging and identification of the problem.

// 8. Check for Native Module Issues:
// If your app uses native modules, carefully check their configurations and installations for any compatibility issues or missing dependencies.

// 9. Expo Community Support:
// Consult the Expo community forum or open an issue on the Expo repository for support. Provide detailed information about the environment, error messages, and troubleshooting steps taken.
