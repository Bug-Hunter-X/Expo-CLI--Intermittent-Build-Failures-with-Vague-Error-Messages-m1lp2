# Expo CLI Intermittent Build Failures

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered with the Expo CLI, where builds would intermittently fail on one machine without providing clear error messages. The build process would succeed on a different machine, indicating the problem might be environment-specific or related to caching issues. The project reproduces this issue on one machine but not another.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run the project on your development machine and on another machine. Note any differences in the build process. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `expo start`.
2. Attempt to build the project for a different platform (e.g., Android or iOS if you started on the other). 
3. Observe the behavior of the Expo CLI during the build. This may require multiple attempts on both machines.

## Expected Behavior

The build should complete successfully on both machines without errors.

## Actual Behavior

The build fails intermittently on at least one of the machines with vague error messages.

## Troubleshooting

The troubleshooting steps involve investigating potential causes such as:
* Clearing the Expo cache (`expo prebuild --clean`).
* Checking the system environment variables.
* Reviewing the system logs for any errors.
* Ensuring consistent versions of Node.js, npm, and the Expo CLI.
* Examining the Expo manifest file for potential issues.
* Testing on simulators/emulators versus physical devices. 

This issue is focused on the inconsistency and lack of actionable error messages in the Expo CLI build process, highlighting the challenges in debugging such problems.
